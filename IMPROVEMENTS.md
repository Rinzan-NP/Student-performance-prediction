# Student Performance Prediction App - Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This update significantly improves the UI and fixes critical data leakage issues that were causing unrealistic model performance.

---

## 🔧 Key Fixes

### 1. **Fixed Data Leakage Issue** ⚠️ (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: The model was using actual test scores (math, reading, writing) as features to predict the average of those same scores
- **Impact**: This caused near-perfect predictions (RMSE ≈ 0, AUC ≈ 1.0), which indicated overfitting
- **Solution**: Removed test scores from features; now only using demographic factors:
  - Gender
  - Race/Ethnicity
  - Parental Level of Education
  - Lunch Type
  - Test Preparation Course
- **Result**: Models now show realistic metrics with proper MAE and RMSE values

### 2. **Fixed ROC Curve Visualization** 📈
- **Problem**: ROC curve was appearing as a straight line due to perfect predictions
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed probability score calculation for ROC curve
  - Now properly normalizes predicted scores to [0, 1] range
  - Added better styling with colored curve and random baseline
- **Result**: ROC curve now displays a proper curve showing model discrimination ability

### 3. **Fixed Model Comparison Display** 📊
- **Problem**: Linear Regression showed RMSE and MAE as zero
- **Solution**: Fixed feature selection and updated comparison table
- **Result**: All models now display proper metrics including:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - R² (Coefficient of Determination)
  - Accuracy
  - AUC (Area Under Curve)

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Visual Design**
- Added custom CSS styling with professional color scheme
- Improved metric cards with background colors and shadows
- Better typography with consistent heading styles
- Professional color palette for charts

### 2. **Better Layout & Organization**
- Reorganized sidebar with clear section headers:
  - 📁 Data & Preprocessing
  - 🤖 Model Configuration
  - ⚙️ Training Configuration
- Improved main content layout with collapsible sections
- Better spacing and visual hierarchy

### 3. **Improved Metrics Display**
- Split metrics into two clear sections:
  - 📐 Regression Metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)
  - 🎲 Classification Metrics (Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity)
- Added helpful tooltips to explain each metric
- Increased decimal precision from 3 to 4 digits

### 4. **Enhanced Model Comparison**
- Added comprehensive comparison table with all metrics
- Split comparison charts into two focused visualizations:
  - Chart 1: MAE & RMSE (error metrics)
  - Chart 2: R², Accuracy & AUC (performance metrics)
- Added color-coded bars for better readability
- Added random baseline reference line (0.5) on performance chart
- Improved chart titles and labels

### 5. **Better Data Overview**
- Compact metric cards showing key statistics at a glance
- Collapsible dataset preview to save space
- Improved correlation heatmap styling

### 6. **Improved Manual Prediction Section**
- Removed test score sliders (no longer needed as they're not features)
- Now only requires demographic information
- Better organized input layout with 3 columns
- Enhanced prediction results display with:
  - Clear metric cards
  - Performance category with emoji indicators
  - Informative message explaining the prediction

### 7. **Enhanced Visualizations**
- Better titles and labels on all plots
- Added grid lines for easier reading
- Improved color schemes
- Better font sizes and weights

## 📈 Technical Improvements

1. **More Realistic Predictions**: Models now predict based on demographic factors only, making predictions more meaningful
2. **Proper Model Evaluation**: Fixed metrics calculation to show true model performance
3. **Better AUC Calculation**: Properly normalized scores for ROC curve generation
4. **Code Quality**: Maintained clean, readable code with no linter errors

## 🎯 Expected Results

With these improvements, you should now see:
- **Linear Regression**: MAE ~10-15, RMSE ~12-18, R² ~0.1-0.3, AUC ~0.6-0.7
- **Decision Tree**: MAE ~10-14, RMSE ~12-17, R² ~0.15-0.35, AUC ~0.65-0.75
- **Gradient Boosting**: MAE ~9-13, RMSE ~11-16, R² ~0.2-0.4, AUC ~0.7-0.8

These are realistic values for predicting student performance based solely on demographic factors.
